# Youtube To Cloud
Add youtube songs to the cloud service you use with a click of a button.

## Spec
The goal of this project is to make it possible and easy to get the music you listen on youtube available on your cloud service as audio files, so it is accessible to you on your multiple devices connected to the cloud. 

To start off I the cloud provider support will be limited to Google Play's Music, because 
that is what the author uses.

But the code will be modular and will follow Open and Close principle, so adding support for other cloud providers like iCloud, DropBox etc should be simple enough in the future. 

Since user interface is of top priority. It should be easy to just select a song at random and add it to your cloud, rather than making a list or a playlist, so I am thinking along the lines of creating a chrome plugin, where you can just click and add the song to your cloud provider. But I am still open to other ideas. 


## Repository Name
The repository name right now is quite boring, I am open for suggestions.
